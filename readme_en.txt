[About MQBoneManager]
MQBoneManager is a provisional library to access bone information on Metasequoia 4.5.6.
Currently, MQBoneManager is provided as a beta version. The compatibilities of the APIs and 
created libraries in the future releases are not ensured.
Now, you can distribute the created plugin to a particular person such as in the same office. 
However, you cannot distribute to an unspecified person such as putting on the web.
Please wait until the MQBoneManager is merged into the Plugin SDK.
